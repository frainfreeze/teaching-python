# Teaching python

This repository was used as reference and to teach basics of python 2.7

This repository is locked as-is with minor modifications. You can find my more up-to-date information and python 3 resource [here](https://frainfreeze.github.io/references/notes/py).

-----------------

For start, little bit about python:
```
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers 
to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

Python supports is object-oriented, imperative and functional programming 
or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory 
management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.
Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, 
allowing Python code execution on a majority of systems.

Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller Python code can be packaged 
into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems, 
allowing for the distribution of Python-based software for use on those environments 
without requiring the installation of a Python interpreter.

Python, is free and open-source software and you can use it however you want.
```
Wondering what can you do with python?
Just about anything your heart desires. I mean it.

We will be using python 2.7 . You can either download it from www.python.org .

Note: if you are Mac or linux user it is likely that you already have python on your system!

After you installed python
----

For windows users:
To start open command prompt by pressing windows key on your keyboard + letter 'r'
following window should pop up:

If you are using unix/linux system open your terminal.

Into terminal or command prompt (depending on system) write 'python' and press enter.
Output similar to following should appear (note: it will be different depending on OS you use):

```
Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:38)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

```

Congratulations! You just started python interpreter and you are ready to start coding!
