#Arithmetic operators
print  3 + 4
print  3 - 4
print  3 * 4
print  3 / 4
print  3 % 2   #Modulus - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder
print  3 ** 4  #Exponent - Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators
print  3 // 4  #Floor Division - The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed.


#Assignment operators
a = 0  #Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
print a

a += 2 #Add AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to left operand
print a

a -= 1 #Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to left operand
print a

a *= 4 #Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to left operand
print a

a /= 2 #Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to left operand
print a

a %= 2 #Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to left operand
print a

a **= 2 #Exponent AND assignment operator, Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand
print a

a //= 2 #Floor Dividion and assigns a value, Performs floor division on operators and assigns value to the left operand
print a



#Comparison operators
print (3 == 4) #Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
print (3 != 4) #Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
print (3 > 4)  #Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
print (3 < 4)  #Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
print (3 <> 4) #Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
print (3 <= 4) #Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
print (3 >= 4) #Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
