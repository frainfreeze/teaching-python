# Lesson 4: operators

Operators in a programming language are used to vaguely describe 5 different areas:
arithmetic, assignment, increment/decrement, comparison, logical.
We will only cover a few of them.

Please open main.py from this lesson inside your editor.
It contains many more comments and explanations.

Arithmetic operators
----
Code:
```python
print  3 + 4
print  3 - 4
print  3 * 4
print  3 / 4
print  3 % 2
print  3 ** 4
print  3 // 4
```
Would output :
```
7
-1
12
0.75
1
81
0
```

You can try it yourself, just as we learned in lesson 2 how to run programs.
____
Assignment operators
----

```python
a = 0
print a

a += 2
print a

a -= 1
print a

a *= 4
print a

a /= 2
print a

a %= 2
print a

a ** = 2
print a

a // = 2
print a
```


a += a is same as we told python a = a + 2.
We are programmers, and we are allowed to be lazy.
____

Comparison operators
----
```python
print (3 == 4)
print (3 != 4)
print (3 > 4)
print (3 < 4)
print (3 <> 4)
print (3 <= 4)
print (3 >= 4)
```

You can find the code inside lesson4 directory named as main.py
execute the code to see output.
