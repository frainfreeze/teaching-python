# Lesson 5: Escape Characters

```python
print "hi I am \n very special string"	#Newline
print "hi I am \t very special string"	#Tab
```

I can put the characters \n (backslash n) in the strings.
These two characters put a new line character into the string at that point.

This \ (backslash) character encodes difficult-to-type characters into a string.
There are various "escape sequences" available for different characters you might want to use.
