# Lesson 2: running programs

In this lesson you will learn how to run python programs.

You will need an text editor.
Notepad can do the job but it doesn't have nice syntax coloring.
You can grab Notepad++ , Sublime text or any other scripting editor you want.

To begin open your new editor and add a new blank file.
Copy and paste following code into your new file.
(Also If you cloned repository to your machine you can open main.py inside this directory)

```python
x = "There are %d types of people." % 10
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not)

print x
print y
```

Just for now you don't need to understand what the code does. Save your file as main.py
If you are using windows press shift+right mouse button and choose "Open command window here"
Type in ```python main.py```

If everything went fine, your screen should look like following:
