This repository is itended to be used for teaching python 2.7

For start, little bit about python:
```
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers 
to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

Python supports is object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.
Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Python code execution on a majority of systems.

Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller Python code can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems, allowing for the distribution of Python-based software for use on those environments without requiring the installation of a Python interpreter.

Python, is free and open-source software and you can use it however you want.
